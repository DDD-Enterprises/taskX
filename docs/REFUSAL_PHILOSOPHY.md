# Refusal Is Not Failure

TaskX refuses before it lies.

Many systems:
- retry silently
- downgrade capability
- swap implementations
- guess user intent

TaskX does none of this.

If a packet is invalid, TaskX refuses.
If a runner is unavailable, TaskX refuses.
If policy is violated, TaskX refuses.

Refusal is not weakness.
Refusal is boundary enforcement.

Boundary enforcement preserves guarantees.
Guarantees preserve trust.

Trust is the entire point.
